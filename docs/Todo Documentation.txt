#Known issues

FIXED for back: 1. Statusbars and back functionality for wizard pages doesnt work. Home-> Login pages are connected with events that set them, but the wizard pages dont. Check js file for more.

FIXED 2. Create login-default.html page (home), extract content of index.html to login-default, keep only top level element in index.
